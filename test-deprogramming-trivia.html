                answers: [
                    "Because he followed Jewish law strictly",

                correct: 1,
                explanation: "Joseph's righteousness was demonstrated by choosing love over law. Rather than publicly shaming Mary (which the law allowed), he chose private divorce to protect her. This shows true righteousness is mercy and love, not rigid rule-following."

                    "Religion is organized external control, spirituality is inner direct connection",

                explanation: "Religion typically involves external authority, dogma, and institutional control over belief and behavior. Spirituality is the direct, personal experience of divine consciousness without intermediaries. Religion often separates us from God; spirituality reveals we ARE divine."
