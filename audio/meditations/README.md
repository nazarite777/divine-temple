## Placeholder Files

Until the actual audio files are generated, the meditation page will display audio players that show an error message when users try to play them. This is expected behavior.

To add your generated audio files, simply place the MP3 files in this directory with the exact filenames listed above.

## File Size Recommendations

- Keep file sizes under 50MB per file for fast loading
